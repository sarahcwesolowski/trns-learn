    "* $\\text{FPR}_R \\equiv$ the same for the false positive rate. AKA 1 - specificity or the probability of a false alarm.\n",
    "* The ratio $R/(1-R)$ represents the ratio of benefits and harms of recommending an intervention. In this case I would assume this means the benefits vs. harms of screening a patient.\n",

    "The advantage of this measure of clinical utility is that its maximum is 1 when the TPR=1 and FPR=0. It is an \"opt-in\" formulation that assumes the default should be not treating or screening the patient. Other measures of clinical utility include the net benefit and relative utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the sNB is that as the risk becomes large, it penalizes a higher false positive rate. As the prevalence becomes higher, it penalizes false positives less. For the rare-disease case, we might expect that the risk is high of non-detection, but that the prevalence is somewhat low. So perhaps we want the threshold $R$ closer to 0 to indicate that the our threshold for screening is low."
